I contacted customer service to see if this could be repaired and was told that since it was a purchase over $300.00, I could only get a refund. I advised them I would be overnighting the ring back and would wait for my refund.

It was the original ring that someone had poorly attempted to close the gap on the band. Not only was there still a gap, but now one side of the ring sat higher than the other. I immediately called customer service because I did not ask for another ring to be sent and explained that I had been waiting for a refund. The rep that I spoke to said he didn\\'t see any documentation of a new ring being shipped or the old one being repaired. He told me that he would call me first thing the next morning after speaking to some of his colleagues to get this resolved. I waited 2 days and still had not heard anything so I called again. I spoke to a different rep who assured me I would have my refund the next day. I told her that I had already been waiting almost two weeks for this refund. She said she would put a rush on it but that never happened. I never did hear back from the 2 reps that I spoke with as they both promised to call me with an update. After waiting over 3 weeks I finally received my refund. My experience with Amazon was horrible. Not only was the product poorly constructed but the customer service department was no help at all.

Please note that I rarely complain about these issues, especially when the amount in controvery is only $35.

After the first week, the liner started to come undone, which was really aggravating because I could feel it kinking up under my heel. Then a few weeks later, the actual foam started to break up and off. That's right!!! The foam that is supposed to provide all this great support started to break off near the front of my left foot insert near the toes. Horrible quality and build! I wouldn't even pay $5 for this useless product. And in case you are wondering, I walk only....no running! That's right, they can't even handle a few weeks of walking without breaking! I attached a picture of what they look like now...pathetic! I also ordered Powerstep Pinnacle Maxx inserts (for a whopping $26) at the same time, and they had the same issue; they also had the liner and foam go bad in just a few short weeks.

I didn't think much about it until I got an e-mail from Joni, the lady in Poplar Bluff, that the socks had arrived.\\nShe told me that you would think that the socks were made of gold the way the people at her free store responded to them. They had NEVER seen such socks!! They were soft and they were thick and warm. Most of them had never even heard of wool socks.\\nNow I don't think twice about wool socks because I love them but it gave me real pause to think that there were people who had never even heard of such a wonderful thing. These people couldn't believe that someone would just give them something this good. Yes, this good.\\nSo if you're thinking of buying some of these why don't you get an extra pair or two and give them to someone who needs them.

       " \"My first review but I have to say......About 15 years ago I developed an allergy to nickle (earrings, necklaces, belt buckles, buttons, bracelets!) and stopped wearing most jewelry. I have to tape over my belt buckles or any metal that contacts my skin and was diagnosed as severely allergic by my doc after allergy skin test. About a year ago I got my ears repierced with my daughter so we could have fun wearing jewelry and have tried every kind of hypo allergenic earring I could find: Studex, Sterling Silver 925, Surgical Steel, 14k gold, and had allergic reactions to all of them if worn for even an hour. Studex that my ears were pierced with was the worst! Bleeding, red itchy swollen earlobes a few weeks to heal in between each time I wore earrings! Searched Amazon for an hour to find these and did some research. They work as promised! I had to force them through (holes had partially closed) and had some initial healing for about 2 weeks. Now I'm wearing them 24/7 no problems! It's a first and really wonderful. I will get more. This size is a bit small for a main earring so I will get the next size up. THANK YOU.\",\n",

My ears are too sensitive for \"sensitive\" earrings and I was about ready to give up and resign myself to clip earrings. Fortunately I found these. They are more expensive than other earrings due to the metal, but well worth it. It\\'s like my ears don\\'t even know they\\'re there :) .',\n",

I decided to try these but honestly didn't expect there to be a difference.  Within hours of wearing these my ears had no discomfort at all.  Again, my ears weren't red or swollen but just had a very minor ache.  I'd recommend these to people even if it's not the last resort to wearing earrings.\\n\\nI also really like the small simple style so these were perfect for me anyway.  I've found it very difficult to find earrings I like in stores because they all seem so big and overbearing.  I'm sure that I will end up buying more pairs of these in a similar style and definitely give preference to titanium earrings.\",\n",

My earlobes would swell, turn red, and bleed immediately after inserting even \"hypoallergenic\" earrings.  I\\'ve tried other brands, such as Simply Whispers, which I really wanted to love, but I simply couldn\\'t wear them.  I\\'d given up and given away most of my earrings and hadn\\'t bought or tried any earrings for a few years.\\n\\nWhen these first arrived, I had trouble inserting them because my earlobes had almost grown closed, and I traumatized my ears a bit.  Over the next several days, I removed them at night, then irritated my ears again when I reinserted them in the morning.  Finally, I decided to just leave them in and allow my ears to heal, and that has worked just fine.  Now my ears have healed, and I haven\\'t bothered to remove the earrings for a couple of weeks.\\n\\nI noticed that in a review for one of the other styles, the reviewer had two complaints: that the ad appeared misleading in that it looked like you were purchasing three pairs of earrings, and that the 3mm size was tiny.  So take note:  you are ordering just one pair of earrings, and the 3mm (mini) size earrings are very small - take a look at a ruler to get an idea - but they provide an understated bit of sparkle.\\n\\nI highly recommend these for people with metal allergies - I\\'m planning to get another pair.',\n",

To ensure the shirts the world sees stay alive for longer, i wear these guys underneath. If I were to rate these shirts lower for any reason, it would be that the collars at the side of my neck wrinkles, But that's specific to me and my body, because my neck is larger than the body size the shirt is built for. At the V of the neck, the shirt maintains it's structure, rests comfortably and it's so thick that I notice it, even when it's under a shirt, a tie and a v-neck sweater. I had a thought of buying another shirt to see if these could be beat, but I can't see the reason to risk it. I realized today that I may be over the clock on buying these and I was. I told myself to replace them every 6 months and it's been a year. Did these shirts lose their color? After a year of my use, and zero bleach, yes. But I don't think there is a single white shirt on the planet that can endure a year with me, my sweat, my abuse and my cleaning techniques. The color fading is the only reason I remembered I needed to replace them.\\n\\nOLDER Revew:\\nI wear white undershirts every day to extend the life of my expensive collard shirts. These guys soak up my sweat, and wash very easy. They also have delivered on being white for longer than quite a few other shirts I have owned before them. I'll be reordering more of these when they wear out, but for now, they're holding up quite well.\",\n",

I love having the different types of amber (very pretty). Since it is a bigger ring, I would suggest you get this for an index or middle finger (unless you won't be wearing another ring on the same hand). I'd also not wear it right next to another ring as the silver band could get scratched. Size is pretty true, but the band is mildly adjustable - I was able to open the band a bit with some well-applied pressure (not easy, but possible).

I think the price is great for what you\\'re getting--you\\'re probably not going to find something like this at the mall, and certainly not at this price. I love the design because it doesn\\'t look like most other silver pieces you see--a rep from the company told me their pieces are designed and produced in Europe.\\n\\nBut I really want to comment on the customer service--it is exceptional!  I got my ring as a gift and it arrived Christmas Eve. Day. I don\\'t know if it was the \"open\" nature of the ring or just a goof but it was too big for my finger, and the stones were already angled such that their mounts were touching, so I was nervous about adjusting it myself. I called up expecting to leave a message (because you don\\'t exchange through Amazon, and they don\\'t have a formal RMA/tracking process, which made me nervous--basically you return it with a letter explaining why) but not only did someone answer the phone, they also answered some questions and set up the exchange without having received the too-large one back first.

I\\'ve bought several of their sterling silver chains, including 2 box links, and the quality exceeded all my expectations in each case.  The chains are sturdy, yet maintain their smooth flexibility over time. There is no \"play\" between the links and, though all are fine guage, even the thinnest has a heft that just feels \"expensive\" (kind of like the sound and solid feel of the closing of an expensive car door).  The clasps easily slide into their housing and the spring is taut yet easy to manage with no \"hanging\".\\n\\n  I personally own only 1 box link chain, one my kids bought me about 10 years ago in a little specialty shop. It was just the right size for me (about 1/16th\" thick link), heavy, and cost $150.00 at the time.  I know, I swallowed my tongue, too.  But it was a very special celebration and came from their hearts with a little help from Mom.  Definitely a stretch on our budget but they felt the chain was important (and I bring it up as a comparative price for fine Sterling 10 years ago). But afterward I learned that there were roving silver artists who sold their work for whatever was necessary to build their business.  We just had to trip over them if we found them at all in this city or that.  Certainly, today you can find cheaply priced silver chains any number of places but, likely as not, you end up with a cheaply constructed chain, possibly even an overlay or plating, links that kink or break, clasps that don\\'t quite \"seat\" properly or fail altogether.  Gem Avenue is the smooth ride on tarmac after a juddering of a day driving over rock-strewn.  These craftsmen take obvious pleasure and pride in their silver-work and it does show.  And to beat it all, they\\'re pricing this fine sterling as if it was costume jewelry.  Oh, and they thoughtfully toss in a nice little jewelry box for each chain purchased.  Why spend so much time reviewing a few silver chains?  Heaven knows if there were problems with the products we\\'d see postings in those CAPITAL LETTERS with which some express their fury that something was not to their liking.  When a company obviously cares about their products and seems to see each silver chain as a representative of their company, as this company appears to, the suits need to know that the people doing the actual creative work are doing a cut above and that brings back repeat and new customers via referral and \"through the grapevine.\\n\\nYou will be quite happily surprised with what you buy here.

The chains are exactly what I was hoping to receive.  They are sturdy without looking cheap (and actuallly look very expensive).  They hang nicely and the clasp looks well made.  I have two silver pendants that I like to wear often so it was important to get a chain for each that would withstand daily wear.  Additionally, I have long hair which can sometimes be problematic when wearing chains.  My hair can get caught in a clump near the clasp or I can inadvertantly break the chain when brushing my hair.  I chose the \"box\" type chain and this type of clasp for these reasons as it\\'s the strongest chain available while still looking dainty.  I\\'m very pleased with both the quality and the price.

I went back and looked on Amazon again the next day and saw a thin box chain, but I didn\\'t know what a box chain looked like and the pictures only showed but so much.  So, I decided to wait.

So, I ran home during lunch that day and went on Amazon to buy the chain.  I was so worried I wasn\\'t going to find a chain that could be delivered to my house by Christmas.  Finally, when I almost gave up, out of all the box chains and sellers on Amazon, there was only one seller, Gemavenue, who\\'s last acceptable order date for the holidays was still within the time limits.  So, I bought their box chain and it was perfect because I was able to choose the length I needed and it was thin but sturdy, like I had been looking for.  I asked for express shipping and ordered it on a Thursday and Christmas was on Tuesday.  The chain arrived that Saturday.  I was so thrilled when it arrived.

       " 'I LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!  I have been riding for almost 15 years, and I can honestly say, that entire time I would long for good warm boots in the winter!!  I would dread getting off at some points because I knew my toes were going to throb the minute they touched the ground!  I do alot of outdoor riding, even in the winter months, and living in Northeast Pennsylvania you NEED a great pair of winter boots.  The older I got, the more I wanted durable, warm boots that were also comfortable enough to wear around the barn.  These are those boots!!  My toes stay warm even during the coldest months of winter and even during a trail ride!  They do feel a tad snug the first few times until they break in, but after that, they are wonderful.  I would recommend these boots for anyone who is looking for a durable, stylish WARM pair of winter boots!!\\n\\nUPDATE APRIL 2014:\\n\\nI JUST had to order another pair!  They lasted me the past 3.5 years and up until about Mid-January/Early February they were still keeping my feet considerably warmer than my warm season paddock boots.  They did start to crack and the soles were coming completely away from the rest of the boot, but I am at the barn 4-5 times a week, sometimes riding 2 or more horses a day.  They DO take a few rides to break in and they are a bit bulkier than your average paddock boot b/c of the insulation but I personally am not a fan of too small of an iron so I have had no issue with them becoming stuck in my irons.  And believe me, my trainer is big on \"drop your irons!\" and I have no problem getting my feet out or back in them.  I also don\\'t lace them all the way up, I leave one out until they get really nice and broken in until I can do that, or my heel doesn\\'t get as far down.  I had actually ordered a pair of Ariat Bossard Insulated Paddock Zips and sent them back b/c they were ridiculously stiff and tight.  Promptly ordered my old go too\\'s and am happy I did because I got them in time to break them in before this winter season was over so no need to worry about that next year!  Happy riding :)',\n",

       " 'This is my second Henschel hat. Ordered the same one that I bought years ago in Las Vegas. My old one is dirty from gardening, so wanted a new \"dinner\" hat. I have many hats...this is my fave. Thanks, Carter.',\n",
       " 'Tested it out in gale force wind while flying my rc models and I did not even use the chin strap and it is COOL on  the head. and perfect fit.',\n",
       " 'Very nice for cutting yards with. Thank you',\n",
       " 'I had to return and get a Large.',\n",

       " 'hubby loves it. he has two, one for the yard and one for going out.',\n",
       " 'Great hat...!  I am a size 6 7/8th and the Medium fits perfectly.\\nCool looking too...!',\n",
       " 'I bought a Medium.  Fits snugly.  Tried a friend\\'s \"large\".  Too big.  Better to be \\'snug\\' which helps keep it on in moderate winds.',\n",
       " \"We gave this to an elder farmer friend and he loves it.  The netting on the top lets the heat vent out, The chin string keeps the hat securely in place while he's cutting hay. And, best of all, it protects his balding head, neck, and ears from the sun's harmful rays.\",\n",
       " 'Really a nice cool hat. Perfect for out in the sun or in the pool. Washes up very easily.',\n",
       " 'The CoolMax Band works great. I did apply some leather softener to the string to make it less stiff.',\n",
       " \"This hat is just what I hoped it would be.  The top and brim are solid, providing sun protection, but the mesh allows for air circulation to keep your head cool.  It's almost identical to the Henschel khaki hat, but this one also has mesh covering the brim, giving it a different style.  Originally thought the cord was unnecessary,  but while golfing in a very strong breeze I had to use the cord to keep the hat from blowing off my head.  The cord goes around the back of the hat when not in use.\",\n",
       " 'Awesome hat',\n",
       " 'This hat will be great in hot weather.',\n",
       " \"The fit is as I expected as it's not my first Henschel hat. I like a,nd use the strap. With a wide brim it does like to move in the wind.\",\n",

       " \"This hat has been perfect for me.  I've used it on many high altitude hikes, and around the house working!  The mesh at the top keeps me very cool and comfortable.  I will buy another one and recommend it to all of my friends\",\n",
       " 'I really like this hat for the price!  It fits well, and I like the fabric (it looks good and it is crushable).  Also, it is a hat with a chin strap, which is important to me, it keeps it from flying away.  I would recommend this hat!',\n",
       " 'This hat fits well and was received in just a few days.  It is just what I have been looking for.',\n",
       " \"Great hat for walking in the desert or working in the back yard in southern Nevada . . . Take off the leather strap - don't need it.\",\n",
       " \"Hat is just what I needed/wanted.  Fits fine, like the stiffer brim which doesn't flop.\",\n",
       " \"I find myself just loving these hats,  I've  written quite a few reviews of many Henschels that I have.  For me, they are well worth it; comfort, style, practical, and well made.  All you have to do is try one or two or three!!!  CoolMax band is unique and adds to comfort, I am from Louisiana, and there is no shortness of heat and humidity here.\",\n",
       " 'This hat is great for Summer.  My husband had one and he liked it so well that I ordered myself one.',\n",
       " 'Fantastic hat and can stuff it in tight places.',\n",

       " 'Bought for my sweetie for his birthday.  He works outside in florida so the sweat band is great, he loved it.\\n\\nThanks.',\n",
       " \"Needed wider brim hat than floppy had been wearing. This hat was cheap enough to abuse and has held up well. My work requires Sunup to dark in  100 degree plus. Hat ends up under gear, on floor of truck or blowing across log yard. Would buy again, well made, pretty good fit, maybe just a little tight but not much. Don't know how it looks, don't care, don't walk around with a mirror. Don't  work in a city.\",\n",
       " 'What a great hat.  I looked and looked, and finally decided on this hat.  I wore it in Egypt and it was great.  Folded in my suitcase and my backpack.  Fit perfectly and had great breezy area so my head kept cool....and I looked cute!  Love it.  Bought one for my friend to wear also.  She loved it, too.',\n",
       " 'He loves it!  He wears it to mow grass, garden and to fish.  Well made, airy and covers the ears which prevents those sunburned ears.',\n",
       " \"I gave this 5 stars because it's a great item.  I bought it for my BF to do yardwork.  He's had it about 3 years now and it's still in great shape.  As a matter of fact, he wants another if I could just find it in blue.  It's easy to clean too. Just drop it in the kitchen sink and clean it up.\",\n",
       " \"I am always nagging my husband to wear a hat to protect him from the sun.  He is very picky about what he's willing to be seen in.  He's always been a boater and since this hat was designed for just that it was an instant hit for him.  It's lightweight, stylish and we even packed it in a suitcase and he used it traveling.  Every time we took it out of the suitcase it popped right back into shape.\\nHaven't tried washing it yet, but it is washable and that is a definite bonus!  Now we're both happy.\",\n",
       " 'Very happy with transaction, and hat. Have had one before, and was very happy to purchase another, and will purchase again and again.',\n",
       " 'I did a fair amount of research for a good hat for golf without paying a huge price for it.  This hat is good quality and the price including shipping was fair and lower than anything else that I could find.  Plus I knew that Amazon would stand behind it.',\n",
       " \"This is the second Breezer hat I purchased in less than a week. The first hat came packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect shape. The second hat, this one, not so good. The hat was crushed. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's crushable. Nevertheless, it took some effort to return it to presentable shape. Otherwise, I love the hats. They fit well, nice shape, vent well, have a chin strap to keep it on in Kansas winds. Good product. I just wish you could count on the packaging. Oh, well, if these last as long as think they will I won't be buying another for quite a while.\",\n",
       " 'This is a good light weight hat that allows for good air flow while protecting from the sun. I like the strap that can be functional or put behind ears on on hat as in picture.',\n",
       " \"The Henschel hat I received was a perfect fit and every thing I could hope for. It's just what I needed for protection from the sun on the golf course' where I play almost every day.\\n\\nThank you for the quick service and a wonderful product.\\n\\nAllen A\\nArk.\",\n",
       " \"without telling my age,I'll just say that I've worn a lot hats and caps in my time.  From my youthful days in the cotton fields to now enjoying my retirement.  I must say that without a doubt this is the most comfortable, and definitely the coolest hat I've ever worn. Love the CoolMax headband.  Plus if you get dirt on it as I did, picking it up with dirty gloves on, It's easy to clean.  I used a wet soft bristle tooth brush with a little mild detergent, brushed the dirt away and let it air dry.\\n  I highly reccomend this hat for anyone.\\nPlus my wife says I really look good with it on!  Doesn't get any better than that!!\",\n",
       " 'This hat is great.  It provides shade for the ears and eyes.  It is comfortabe even on the hottest days because the top venilates the head.  My skin doctor encourged me to get a hat like this because I have had some skin cancer on my ear. Lastly, the price is right.',\n",
       " 'Bought this hat to use out in the yard when doing yard work to block the sun. It works just as I hoped it would, A quality hat that fits nice and snug and does not blow off in the wind.  Has a large brim to block the sun off the ears and back of the neck and your head still breaths with the mesh top. I would rcommend this hat. Did not understand, why UPS shipped it to the US Post Office and then the post office delivered it to my home. Waisted a day on delivery when UPS could of dilerved it the the house, which, by the way was not shipped for free!',\n",
       " \"The material quality was good and the style was nice. However the hat was out of shape when I opened the box. It was also a little tight. Checking their return policy I found that I would have to pay for the return shipping fee which was almost half the price of the hat itself. I decided to keep it as a working hat when I do my yard work. Few days later I received an email from their customer service asking me about how pleased I was with their product. I told them I wasn't pleased with the condition of the hat, but decided not to return due to high return shipping fee. To my surprise they sent me next day a prepaid UPS label with which I returned the hat requesting for an exchange. Yesterday I received the exchange. This time they packed the hat snuggly inside a box, which was packed inside another larger box with packing paper. Although it took long time to receive the exchange their customer service is superb. I will buy product(s) from them again in the future.\",\n",

       " 'Ordered this hat because every other hat I had made my head sweat, that ran into my eyes when hiking. This hat works great, beyond expectations. Made in the U.S.A. makes it perfect. Sizing for me was right on.',\n",
       " 'My husband only wore baseball cap style hats.  I was thrilled that he really likes this hat and now wears it all the time, and it looks great on him.  Plus, it covers his ears from sun damage, a common place for men to get skin cancer.',\n",
       " \"Yes it is nice and the mesh allows the wind to cool your head.  Can't wait for the 137 degree summer.\",\n",

       " 'I bought this for my son, and he absolutely LOVES it!  The color (khaki) is great, its adjustable chin strap is wonderful, it flattens down nicely for packing, and the mesh insert does a good job of keeping his head cool.  We are very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend buying this high-quality hat.',\n",
       " 'I love the breezer hat I bought.  For golf, there is nothing better and I am going to buy another for fishing.  I do not like the leather strap that you can use to keep the hat from flying off.  I took mine off and threw it away because it was too stiff and uncomfortable and the stay device just slipped too much. For my fishing hat I am going to buy, I will put a cord and a better cinch device on myself.',\n",
       " \"Hat is well constucted and truely allows air flow to keep the sun off while not holding the heat in.  From a distance you can't even see that is isn't a regular hat.\",\n",
       " 'The hat was perfect for our vacation -- fit well, was cool in the sun and offered great sun protection.',\n",
       " 'Best camping hat I have ever owned. Tough and comfortable. The mesh crown allows good airflow over the head, the solid top prevents your skull from roasting, and the wide brim provides cool, shady face and neck proection even when the sun is low in the sky. If you want to make a fashon statement, get something else. However, if you are an outdoor person who values good, servicable gear that does what you need it to do, get this hat.',\n",
       " \"Love this Hat. It keeps my shorn head cool and protected. The price was 1/3 that of the hat I originally considered.  One of my best purchases. .  I would not hesitate to buy another one.  The description says its crush able, but I like it so much I'm afraid to 'test' it.\",\n",

I have in the past bought them from a local hat shop, but Amazon had the same hat for $25 instead of $40. its comfortable, cool, and when it gets dirty, I spray it with the stuff I wash the car with, clip it to a fence and hose it off. it drips dry and looks great again.
